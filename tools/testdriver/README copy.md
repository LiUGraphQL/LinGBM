# Test Driver <br/> of the Link√∂ping GraphQL Benchmark (LinGBM)

This directory contains the test driver program of the benchmark, which is developed based on a [basic version of the test-driver](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/evaluation-graphql-server-techniques/tree/master/test-driver).
It is a command lind utility that requires the path to the actualQueries directory generated by the querygen tool. 

# Usage

1. Start up the server and database by running the supplied docker-compose files.
2. When they are up and running you need to generate the queries with the querygen too.
3. Build this utility by running `yarn run build`.
4. Run the test-driver by running `yarn start -a ACTUALQUERIES_PATH`

ACTUALQUERIES_PATH needs to be the path were the generated queries are. This tool will then synchronously load all the generated queries and run them one by one. Capturing the time for each query and posting it to STD_OUT.
