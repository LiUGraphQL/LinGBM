# Test Driver <br/> of the Link√∂ping GraphQL Benchmark (LinGBM)

This directory contains the test driver program of the benchmark, which is developed based on a [basic version of the test-driver](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/evaluation-graphql-server-techniques/tree/master/test-driver). More specifically, this program could collect the statistics of backend database during execution of a query.

The required input for the test driver is the path to the actual queries directory generated by the querygen tool. 


### Setup
Before starting the test driver, you have to first start up the GraphQL server, and generate the queries with the [querygen](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/LinGBM/tree/master/tools/querygen).
Then, you could build up the test driver using the following command:

```
git clone git@github.com:LiUGraphQL/LinGBM.git
cd LinGBM/tools/testdriver_TP/
npm install
yarn run build
```

### Usage

To capture the throughput of each query template, please use the following example command:
```
yarn start -a ACTUALQUERIES_PATH
```
The ACTUALQUERIES_PATH needs to be the path where the generated queries are.

```
yarn start -a ACTUALQUERIES_PATH -q 1
```

In addition, there are also some other arguments can be used to change the configuration of the test driver:
| Argument | Description |
| ------ | ------|
|-a, --actual-queries \<path>|Path to actualQueries folder| 
|-c, --clients \<clients> |Number of clients. Default: 1| 
|-s --server <url> |URL to the GraphQL server to test. Default: localhost |
|-p --port <port> |Port used by the GraphQL server. Default: "4000"|
|-t --type <type> |Type of test to run, tp (throughput). tp |
|-i --interval <interval> |How long the test should run for. Default: 30 sec|
|-o --name <name> |Set the name of the output file |
|-q, --queryTP <queryTP> |Set the queryTemplate to test|
|-r, --repeat <repeat> |Set the number of times to repeat the test. Default: 1|
