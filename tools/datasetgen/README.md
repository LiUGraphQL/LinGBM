# Dataset Generator <br/> of the Link√∂ping GraphQL Benchmark (LinGBM)
LinGBM uses the [datasets of the Berlin SPARQL Benchmark](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/spec/Dataset/index.html) (BSBM), which can be generated by the [BSBM data generator](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/spec/BenchmarkRules/index.html#datagenerator). This directory contains a slightly extended version of this data generator. The original source code of the BSBM data generator can be found at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsbmtools/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bsbmtools/).

We had to extend the original BSBM data generator to obtain some additional metadata when generating a dataset. This metadata is needed for our query generator.

### Setup

To generate a dataset for the benchmark, first clone this repo and change to the directory `./LinGBM/tools/datasetgen`.

```
git clone git@github.com:LiUGraphQL/LinGBM.git
cd LinGBM/tools/datasetgen
```

### Usage

For the instructions and command options for using the data generator refer to the [documentation of the BSBM data generator](http://wifo5-03.informatik.uni-mannheim.de/bizer/berlinsparqlbenchmark/spec/BenchmarkRules/index.html#datagenerator). The data generator supports different output formats such as an SQL dump, RDF N-Triples, RDF/XML, and RDF Turtle.

As an example, the following command generates the dataset with scale factor 1000 and writes this dataset as an SQL dump:

```
java -cp lib/* benchmark.generator.Generator -pc 1000 -s sql
```

As an alternative, the same can be achieved by the following command:

```
./generate -pc 1000 -s sql
```

**Note:** In our version of the data generator, we have disabled the command option `-fc`. As a result, the data generator by default connects each product only to a most specific type in the product type hierarchy (rather than also connecting it to the corresponding supertypes).
