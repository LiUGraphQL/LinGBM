# Link√∂ping GraphQL Benchmark (LinGBM)
LinGBM is a performance benchmark for GraphQL server implementations.
Currently, [the wiki of this repo](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/LinGBM/wiki) contains the design artifacts of LinGBM. As we progress with the development of the benchmark, we will add the benchmark specification, benchmark artifacts such as the query templates and the benchmark schema, as well as the benchmark software.
