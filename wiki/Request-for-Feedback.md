We--researchers of the [Database and Web Information Systems Group](https://www.ida.liu.se/divisions/adit/dwis/) at [Link√∂ping University](https://liu.se/)--are developing a performance benchmark for GraphQL server implementations. We now have completed the following three parts of the benchmark specification and we are seeking feedback on these parts. 
* [Data schema of the benchmark](Data-Schema-of-the-Benchmark)
* [Query workloads of the benchmark](Query-Workloads-of-the-Benchmark)
* [Performance metrics](Performance-Metrics)

As a basis for reading the descriptions of these parts, we suggest to first read the brief [introduction to our benchmark project](Introduction-to-the-LinGBM-Project).

You may provide feedback by i) opening a [new issue](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/LinGBM/issues/new) in the Github repo of our benchmark or ii) [email](https://liu.se/en/employee/olaha93).
