In addition to the [benchmark datasets](Datasets), the Link√∂ping GraphQL Benchmark (LinGBM) is based on a GraphQL schema for exposing any version of the benchmark dataset as a GraphQL API. Essentially, this schema contains an object type for each of [the types of entities in the benchmark dataset](Datasets#entity-relationship-diagram) (products, producers, vendors, etc). The fields of each such object type match the attributes of the corresponding entity types. Additionally, we have specified a few other fields and object types, as well as some enumeration types and input types, which had been required to define the [query workloads of the benchmark](Query-Workloads-of-the-Benchmark).

The actual [file that defines the LinGBM GraphQL schema](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/LinGBM/blob/master/artifacts/apischema.graphql) is available in the [github repo of LinGBM](https://github.com/LiUGraphQL/LinGBM/). Moreover, we have specified a [schema mapping](Schema-Mapping) that defines how the elements of the LinGBM GraphQL schema map to the database schema of the benchmark dataset.

We emphasize that the LinGBM GraphQL schema is relevant only for the first of the [two scenarios captured by LinGBM](Introduction-to-the-LinGBM-Project#scenarios). GraphQL schemas as used in the second scenario are auto-generated by the corresponding systems under test.
